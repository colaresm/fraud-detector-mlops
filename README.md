#  Iris Flow API

**IrisFlowAPI** is a complete machine learning project focused on classifying Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). It integrates the entire MLOps pipeline ‚Äî from model training and experiment tracking to serving predictions through a production-ready API.

## üîç Project Overview

This project trains a supervised learning model on the classic Iris dataset. The model is managed and tracked using **MLflow**, ensuring reproducibility and experiment versioning. Once trained, the model is served via a RESTful API built with **Flask**, allowing external applications to send requests and receive predictions.

## üöÄ Features

- Supervised model training with evaluation metrics
- Model tracking and versioning with MLflow
- RESTful API using Flask to serve real-time predictions
- Dockerized infrastructure with separate containers for API and MLflow
- Unit tests and Integration for endpoints and internal modules

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- Flask
- MLflow
- Scikit-learn
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Pytest

### Running the project

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
